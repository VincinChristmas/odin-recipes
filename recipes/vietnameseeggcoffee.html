<!--Introduction to Vietnamese egg coffee-->
<h4>Though I have been to Vietnam many times, I have never had Vietnamese
    egg coffee there. I learned how to make this coffee when I was in China, actually,
    using a Chinese app that taught me how to cook food. It just so happens that they 
    had many coffee recipes on the menu as well; Vietnamese egg coffee was one of them.
    I did research on the interenet and by asking around. I found out that this coffee
    is authentic. It is not popular all over Vietnam but is popular in one region in 
    North Vietnam. Many people make this in a variety of ways. Here is mine recipe.

<!--The ingredients-->
<h1>Ingredients</h1>
<ul>
    <li>two egg yolks only(get rid of albumen--the egg white)</li>
    <li>condensed milk</li>
    <li>two espresso shots</li>
    <li>Moka pot</li>
    <li>Egg beater</li>
    <li>a glass coffee cup</li>
</ul>

<!--The instructions-->
<h1>The Steps</h1>
<ol>
    <li>put two egg yolks in a bowl with 2 and a half tablespoons of condensed milk
        (can put a little less to make it less sweet)
    </li>
    <li>use an egg beater to mix the eggs and the condensed milk for about
        three minutes or until it is thick enough to float on water. Can 
        test a drop of it on water.
    </li>
    <li>use the moka pot to make the two espresso shots. The amount that can be
        made in a moka pot is exactly two cups. If you don't know how to make a 
        coffee in a moka pot, please read my moka pot instructions <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Use-a-Moka-Pot" target="_blank"><i>here</i></a>
    </li>
    <li>pour the coffee into the cup</li>
    <li>pour the egg and condensed milk mixture on top of the coffee.</li>
    <li>sprinkle with cinnammon or a spice of your choice.</li>
    <li>can drink as is or enjoy the egg and condensed milk mixture with a spoon first. </li>
</ol>
