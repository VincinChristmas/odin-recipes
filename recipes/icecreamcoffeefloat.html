<!--Introduction to ice cream coffee float-->
<h4>I know that ice cream coffee float has beeen around for ages, but I 
    have never heard of it until I started using a Chinese app called <a href="https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%8E%8C%E5%8E%A8/18353401" target="_blank">
        掌厨.</a>When I first heard of it on this app and tried it for myself, I thought that it was very delicious. This can be made using a variaty of 
    methods. It all depends on how you want the flavor to be. This is one of the kinds of cofee that I think goes great with <a href=
    "https://saturnbird.myshopify.com/collections/all-coffee">Shanghai's Saturnbird Coffee</a>, which is a delicious and new type of coffee
made only in Shanghai.</h4>
